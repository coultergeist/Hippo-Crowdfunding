# Salve Yourself: Hippo Crowdfunding Campaign
Description/Introduction: Salve is something that I learned how to make at a summer camp in elementary school. We would pick herbs and plants from the backyard, and with the help of beeswax, we would mix everything together in a hot pan, put it in a container, and bring it home. Since I started making it at least 12 years ago at this point, I swear by this stuff. It's great for chapped lips, wounds, sore muscles, etc.

What we need to prepare beforehand:
   1. Emails. Emails going out to people who donate, saying thank you for donating. A written email going out to a handful of people   beforehand, introducing the product.
   2. A list of what we need to make the salve, so that we can prepare to make it.
   3. Record a video about how to make the salve.
   4. Thank you notes ready to sign, address, and mail to people.
